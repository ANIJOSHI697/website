## v2
This is a complete rewrite of the Warzone website in React. This README will be updated with more info soon.

### To Do 
- **Switch to [Next.js and Preact](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@zeit/next-preact)**
  - Unfortunately I started writing this website before I found out about Next.js and Preact. They are both great technologies and I really want to start using those on this project.
- Improve this README
- More info on homepage
- Slowly migrate to React Hooks

- Match info page
- Player info page
- Leaderboards page
- Play page
- Privacy policy page
